Define Snooz packages
=======================

To manage the packages
=======================

Navigate to **File -> Settings -> Packages**.

During the initial installation of Snooz, the packages that come with Snooz are activated (checked) by default. Each package can be expanded, allowing you to activate (check) or deactivate (uncheck) individual tools or modules within the package.
