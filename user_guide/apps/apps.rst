This section describes how to use apps within Snooz. 

An app is a type of item that Snooz can load dynamically. 
As it names suggest, it's basically an full fledged application that runs within Snooz. 
Multiple apps can be registered in Snooz but only one app can run at the time.

For now, there is only a single app in Snooz, which is the Oximeter viewer.
