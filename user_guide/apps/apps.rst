This section describes how to use apps within Snooz. 

An app is a type of item that Snooz can load dynamically. 
As it names suggest, it's basically an full fledged application that runs within Snooz. 
Multiple apps can be registered in Snooz but only one app can run at the time.

The primary purpose of apps is to explore a single polysomnography (PSG) recording and, if needed, modify the associated signals or annotations. 
For this reason, apps can be opened through the **File**-> **Open** menu, which may prompt the user to select a file. 
Apps can also be accessed through the category menu, similar to how tools are accessed.

For now, there is only a single app in Snooz, which is the Oximeter viewer.
