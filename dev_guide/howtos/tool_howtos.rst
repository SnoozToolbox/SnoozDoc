How to create a tool
==================================
We use a command line to help create new tool. To access the terminal in VS Code, make sure to close Snooz beforehand. 

- In VS Code navigate to **Terminal -> New Terminal**
- Select your repository you forked from snooz-package-template (e.g. my_snooz_repo)
- Make sure the virtual environment **snooz_310_env** is activated (see :ref:`installation`)
- In the terminal type : ``python main_utils.py``
- Select **3- Create a tool**
- Fill the information to suit your design. If you make any mistakes, just repeat the steps and it will ask to overwrite the previous one.  If you need more information, see :ref:`info_tools`.
